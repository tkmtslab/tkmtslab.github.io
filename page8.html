    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p><strong>名前：田中紫織（Shiori Tanaka）</strong></p><p>
</p><p><br></p><p>There are two reasons why I chose Tokimatsu laboratory. First, because Tokimatsu lab have not only single technological insight but also social and economic insight although it is in science and technology university. Second, because prof. Tokimatsu have honor educational strategy: To aim making students acquire ability which is useful after graduation. And I found my choice was correct. I have to appreciate for my supervisor deeply.
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">Especially when it comes to the later reason, there are so many things that people cannot get in other laboratories in Tokyo tech. After I joined short-term English learning program in Singapore during my bachelor, I eagerly wanted to study abroad again. However I had a conviction that the thigs that I can learn from packaged studying trip such as English program or exchange are limited. So I was seeking opportunity to experience field research or internship in foreign countries. Prof. Tokimatsu helped me a lot to achieve that. He introduced various professor who would potentially help my survey all over the world in addition to financial support. Because of these opportunities, I could be more active, could get management skill, communication skill, and English skill and so on. I am sure these skills will be helpful even after the graduation.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">I know some of the professors regard students as employee or even slave to conduct their own researches. However, Prof. Tokimatsu is completely different. He always treat students as his son or daughter and pursue how he can contribute to the students. &nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">However, it was not just enjoyable during my school life. Applicants have to remember these three things. First, because our laboratory has various areas of studies, supervisor do not have time to teach everything from basic to students. We always had to learn by our self. Also, please be prepared to be pretty busy for two years. It is necessary to do research, study abroad (and preparation), classes, job hunting activities and laboratory office work within two years. However, it is especially difficult for students entering from master. To concentrate on only research is impossible. Because Tokimatsu Laboratory has no secretary (as of March 18), Japanese students are responsible for various administrative tasks and support for foreign students, but it is unexpectedly time consuming for these things to happen.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">You can make time to work as part-time, but it is not recommended. Although the cost of studying abroad was aided by the JASSO scholarship and the laboratory, the necessary money in daily life and the transportation expenses during job hunting were always stress sources for me. I wish I had applied for a scholarship at the time of enrollment or had borrowed money from my parents.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">However, there is no doubt that it is an environment that students can grow a lot. If you are interested, please visit the laboratory, talk to your teacher and seniors carefully and see whether our lab fits you or not.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
</p><p> 
</p><p><strong>Professor's comment：
</strong></p><p>　</p><p>&nbsp;My first met with her was beginning of April in three years ago, in a briefing session for prospective students for our old department. She was one of the students visited to our three laboratories, gave us some inquires related to sustainability and happiness. She had proactively contacted with me to visit our lab for three times before application form submissions, and communicated what she had in mind and desires. She got too nerves to convey them to me although she intended to do so, I many times got her relaxed to speak frankly.
</p><p>
</p><p>　</p><p>After enrollment, she always bowed and expressed her gratitude to me very polite and bright when passing in front of my office. I was learnt from her the importance of such a bright and polite greeting after I became the position to be given. I soon recognized through discussions her brightness since she had a good manner to think by herself until she felt understood and try do her best to express as her digested.
</p><p>
</p><p><br></p><p>Her first business trip was to Ama-cho in Okinoshima island. I felt great potential in her absorbing power through her proactive attitude wherever to go by any chance. This opportunity was accidentally her birthday present. It was our great challenges indeed to find hosts for her sending survey trip in M1 grade. As the client (she) desired repeatedly “I really would like to go Denmark, the world top-ranked country in happiness”, all the efforts and resorts I could inspire had been made. I suggested her to go longer and many countries as possible and determine as her own will, since I spent all the efforts as far as I could and required admin procedure is only one time. She met to my expectation, visiting 4 countries in 5 months including visits to several international organizations in Switzerland with Takaki san, which was maximum numbers within her availability. Such a long visit enabled her to recognize directly and objectively real situation of the world top-ranking happiness countries.
</p><p>
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;After finalizing job-hunting, next survey trip in M2 grade was Asian countries, especially Singapore and neighboring countries. She determined by her own will to visit Bhutan as well even if she spent her own money since our budget was still uncertain at that time. She fully used my networks so far I had been built, resulted in visiting 3 countries in 4 months including an intern experience at NUS/ESI. She recorded Guinness-book class achievements by her ultra-super energetic action; she collected some 200 samples during just only 10 days stay in Bhutan.
</p><p>
</p><p>　</p><p>&nbsp;After such experiences including job hunting, in winter season in M2 grade, she seemed to gain self-confident, showing calm and stable. She had grown up as if she were not the same person who were so nervous after interview to a faculty in summer season in M1 grade just before leaving. She was spontaneously willing to present her visiting experiences inside and outside of our university, in international workshops and domestic conferences. Based on academic journal writing experiences, supervised by prof Kurishima in Shibaura Institute of Technology for another survey in Tateyama, finally she could summarize by her own these great surveys into three peer-reviewed journal papers to submit.
</p><p>
</p><p><br></p><p>I always talk to, not only her but all our lab members, that “This is the Tanaka project. Tanaka san is your project leader, while I take responsibility to society. You can make final decision by your own will while I suggest various choices and provide opportunities.” I never said “you must do this” while only one time “you must not do this” to her. She had been so motivated and filled with enthusiasm that she had been a student for worth taking care as such and given me reward, since once I put my thoughts into words she always expressed she would like to try any chance eagerly and positively, then immediately spend all her efforts to respond my expectation. Because of her such aggressive attitudes had driven me let her inform all solely I can give to her.
</p><p>
</p><p><br></p><p>Coming back to her “original and big consciousness” in her seeking graduate courses, research topics are obliged to be limited so that it must be stylized as academic researches, however, most are satisfied that she had in mind at that time such as staying abroad, internship, foreign students relations in our daily laboratory life, human relations, happiness, and socio-economic systems. From that day it passed three years. Our two year experiences always discussing lots of things are filled with intense feeling. I am fully gratitude to her for her giving highest happiness as an academic advisor to me.</p></div>

            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p><strong>高木寛人 (TAKAKI Hiroto):</strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">During bachelor term, I was feeling a limit for my interest and motivation to my research topic (superconductivity), and looking for a new graduation university office to meet my interest and an area which my ability is useful. Since Prof. Tokimatsu was eagerly telling me about his research topics, I felt his high motivation to educate students and I chose to enroll the laboratory.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>Thanks to a kind support by him and his previous student, I successfully passed the scholarship examination called "Tobitate Ryugaku JAPAN". His contributive support and a miracle luck gave me the acceptance institute and I went Germany for three months. At the second year, I was studying abroad to Sweden to discuss deeply my research topic. While I was asking "What do I gain through the studying abroad?" to myself, I was shocked on my powerless. However, overcoming such difficult encouraged my growing up.
</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, I could feel international environment through the overseas activities, but it is same in the office as well. It was natural that Indonesian is sitting at next an official language on the seminar is spoken in English. Looking for a kindergarten for Indonesian father or guiding Iranian Taiwan where I visited for the first time was so hard but, I gained the ability to think what I never experienced and to transfer quickly the thought to action.
</p><p><br></p><p>Through the activities in Tokimatsu lab, I could find the origin of motivation so that I became to be able to encourage myself at a difficult time. Especially such meaning, I had a really good time before becoming a social worker. To consider this two years as resources for my power, I would return my ability to make the society better not only for domestically but also internationally.
</p><p><br></p><p>Tokimatsu lab is freedom. All from the theme to methodology depends on you, so that little your effort would result in bad. Thus, to find the way to keep motivation at a hard time for your research is a solution to have a happy time for two years. If you have interested us, don't hesitate to contact and knock the door, please. Thank you so much.
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Professor's comment：
</strong></p><p>　</p><p>&nbsp;The first contact from Takaki san was by email, stating that he would like to meet up with me in a later day because I had been absent from a briefing session for prospective students. What he had in mind was that he was engaging in simulation study for superconductivity in theoretical physics; interested in socio-economic aspects of such new technologies, in energy issues especially renewables; and in working for supporting governments. My memories in my grad students (more than 20 years) returned to me like a flashback. I recommended him to apply my fellow labs in the Univ of Tokyo, however, he chose my lab by his “prudent” decision. I missed to confirm this decision, expecting his decision was not incorrect as he could learn from lots of experiences and gain abilities required for working in society through communications with foreign students in daily laboratory life and oversea experiences for conducting research.
</p><p>
</p><p>He had visions, firm will, and well prepared for, such as “Tobitate to overseas from Japan” program and internship in ISEP, before enrollment so that he can spend beneficial time in his grad course. He proceeded without any help by me - application forms and documents were well read through by his own and editing requests were given to a senior in our lab. Detailed are omitted because of space limitations, during two year experiences, I had faced and was helped by him so many times after his enrollment with his such overwhelming ability – well preparation in admin procedure including oversea study and detailed inspections on (complicated and confusing) admin documents.
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">He was calm and stable, without “moving targets” in both job hunting and conducting researches once he had set, unlike to those guys ages in Ms grad as they are curious in everything and interests are hopping from one to another. We can concentrate on our discussions in the set targets, without consuming our efforts and time for that setting.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">&nbsp;His style in conducting research was also stable and steady, reflecting his inherent character. He settled down to dig his work in “developing rails” by his own from scratch, not by running on “prepared” rails. Genuine experiences (both sweet and bitter) in conducting research activities – highly intelligence, freedom in academy – were most precious services in education and research when comparing with my own, past experiences in the national institute and think-tanks over 20 years after graduation.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">He expressed my supervision that I “directed” goal while students “derive” story - far from the stereo type such as “you must do this”. As if I were an apparel clerk recommending cloths to try on, I tried to clarify his awareness in mind and to draw final images with him. I had waited until he can step forward by his own will. During he was muddled without progress, I was not hurry him up, watch carefully, and cheered up. He could move from one step to three and further, after finding his initial results in the beginning of M2 grade. The timing had come – he cleared his targets one by one, such as peer-reviewed paper submission and amendment in journals and international conferences, presentations, and another oversea research in Chalmers, to finalize his thesis.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">&nbsp;He is always cool, stable, and smiling. He always recognizes his working territories while surrounding works were also taken care spontaneously, without my requests, by understanding overall situations. Three years from his first contact, two year daily life with him was so significant that I express my sincere thanks to him for his giving highest happiness as an academic advisor.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p></div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>Greetings!
</p><p>I am very happy to conclude my 9 weeks of Tokyo Tech life. The experience of TKT Campus
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">Asia program at Tokimatsu sensei’s lab became one of my stepping - stone which guides me</span></p><p>the next goal to me. I appreciate that I could challenge myself to seek the topic that I have
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">interested in. And I feel gratitude to my supportive professor Tokimatsu, the staffs of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">Campus Asia Program and the lab mates who inspired me in the daily life.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"><br></span></p><p>In Tokyo tech, I could spend time following my curiosity towards Aquaponics system and Life
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">Cycle Thinking. The motivation was to figure out the appropriate level of aquaponics system&nbsp;</span></p><p>for developing countries since I believe the aquaponics system combined hydropincs and
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">aquaculture can solve food insecurity in the developing countries. With the supportive&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">research atmosphere, I could keep find answers for my successive questions throughout
&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">literature reviews and commentary from professor. During the program, I could understand&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">the challenges of the aquaponics system and discover the research opportunities regarded&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">the topic: LCA and TEA on an aquaponics system. Greatfully, the professor Tokimatsu&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">suggested me to apply for the Ecobalance 2018 conference. Although I have longer step to
&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">participate for the conference, I submitted the abstract last Feb. This would be my next&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">motivation for me to conduct the research when I go back to Korea.</span></p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>Moreover, cultural experience and learning Japanese were another interesting parts during&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">the program. Even though both of Korea and Japan share South East Asia’s common cultural</span></p><p>background, still I could discover small and big spectrum differences. I got impression by&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">Japanese sophisticated products and user friend designed service in Japan. On the other&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">hand, I still have unsolved curiosity on IT Technology acceptance in Japan. Although Japan&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">was one of the fastest industrialized country in Asia, I couldn’t see the Uber, sharing bicycle,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">food delivery application which is now very widespread in China and Korea. I wondered the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">underneath background.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">Lastly, I’d like to mention about my laboratory. Under the very liberal and diverse&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">atmosphere in the lab with numerous international friends, I enjoyed the communication a</span></p><p>lot with my lab mates. I could think about the sound attitude to the research, and learn how&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">to encourage others. I’d like to express my last appreciation to my lab mates, Muhammad</span></p><p>who were very willingness to encourage about my research, Takaki who was teaching me&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">daily Japanese words, the great buddy Jo, Reza who provides considerate commentaries, Pai</span></p><p>who became my best friend, Rico who is guidance of all Indonesian cuisine, and all the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">members I met in the lab.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">Back in Korea, I brought the several future tasks from Japan, but I am very happy to take this&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">responsibility and the chance of learning. Thank you!</span></p><p>ありがどうございます！</p></div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>During more than two years in Tokimatsu laboratory, I made self-growth as the target and worked hard for it, meanwhile I got great assistance from professor and other students. As the result, I established the necessary values for a future member of Japan society. In addition, I obtained a lot of knowledge that could not be learned from textbooks, as well as several ability and culture.
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"></span><br></p><p>&nbsp; Firstly, I accumulated a large amount of culture and knowledge in the laboratory, thus this process could be a preparation for practice in real job. In the laboratory, I learned environmental technology, energy system, MOT (Management of Technology), and knowledge of economics or finance, and I think it is such a diversification of knowledge, so that I never felt boring. Additionally, about the foreign language as Japanese and English, I improved skills of listening, speaking, reading, writing, and translation based on the experience from presentation or other activities inside or outside the university.
</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, I managed to obtain the opportunity to come into contact with advanced technology or science and culture in Japan or abroad because of the laboratory. I got the chance to go to study meeting introduced by the professor, not only did I saw the eternal development history and the high-quality technology in Japan, but also did I get to know the reason that Japan had been standing on the top of worldwide technologies, which is the outstanding technology management. In addition, when I made a short-term visit to United States, the laboratory gave me a great deal of financial help. Through these exchange activities, I obtained a great experience of discussing with excellent scientific researchers or business owners.
</p><p><br></p><p>Finally as the most important thing, I refined my personality after I began to feel the serious research attitude from professors and other students in the laboratory. They were always trying their best to focus on the research, seriously discussing why the outcomes were gotten based on various fields of knowledge. The experience of working hard to be the similar person is a big treasure for me; it might lead me to a steady expand of future job and a higher stage in the workplace.
</p><p><br></p><p>Additionally when we mention the disadvantage of the laboratory, it is that the lab life is too busy. Basically there was no spare time for you to make a part-time job outside the laboratory. As a lab member, you had better think about your living expenses as early as possible, lend it or get it from your parents.
</p><p><br></p><p>The 2.5 years life in Tokimatsu laboratory may be too short for the whole journey of life, but it is really a satisfied and shiny life experience. Fulfilled with swear and gain, the experience was an essential time in my life road for chase the ultimate dream. Lastly I want say THANK YOU SO MUCH to professor Tokimatsu and other members.
</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Testimonials from Professor:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>I will never forget the strong email I received from Ore starting with [Professor Tokimatsu] when I just took up the position. He is originally from China, studied in Liverpool, and in love with Japan. He drew a punch picture analyzing all lessons and skills that he has acquire during his enrollment. The paper he drew is now one of my precious items. It was my first experiment as teacher, which made an impression on me of value of teaching students. I choose being his supervisor after he successfully passed the entrance exam.  
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"></span><br></p><p>He planned his schedule, classes and his own research according to the calendar. Within a limited time, he managed to study about Actuary of Life Insurance and did the job-hunting activities. He was fortunate of being dispatch to Rochester Institute of Technology and conducted his studies under the supervision of Mr. Mitsutaka Matsumoto. He learned about the Multi regression analysis from his colleague Masataka Maeda and he managed somehow to understand it. He (Including me) thinks he is a pleased with his surrounding environment. Regarding his contribution of the lab’s focused areas, As one method of technical forecasting, he made use of the technical economy and studied deeply about the applicability of technology diffusion. He also used a statistic method to try out the factor analysis.
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">In his case, because setting a goal and constantly improving and gradually obtain results is a suitable way for him, he managed to move forward and bring out the results. I feel happy. With his optimistic personality and his advanced communication skill he finished with his oral presentation with out asking for an assistance from his supervisor. As a master student, is something deserve to be written about him. Regarding his contribution to the lab, Mastering, Japanese, Chinese and English, and acquiring the Japanese style of communication, and also being in charge of the lab parties… this is extortionary. &nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p></div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead">Among so many variety of graduate schools and laboratories, I chose Tokimatsu Laboratory. That is because what I heart from Prof. Tokimatsu, he made me believe that I could carry out the research decided by myself. Prof. Tokimatsu really established a comfortable environment for research, and his frankness is also attractive. As the result, my image stays the same as the fact in laboratory.
<div><br></div><div>Prof. Tokimatsu gave me a great opportunity to study abroad twice, and I managed to study abroad in Singapore and the United States. To be honest, to study abroad brought only memories about hard time both on life and research. I still trust that the experience will no doubt help my own future life.
</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, Tokimatsu Laboratory, with Yoshikawa Laboratory and Takahashi Laboratory, together sets up seminars. There come foreign students from various countries. I received a lot of stimulus and learned so much knowledge about culture from them. Moreover I made friends with them who could never be involved in my daily life.
</div><div><br></div><div>After my entry into Tokimatsu Laboratory, I felt the totally different environment as before. Thanks to that, I did humanly grow up a lot. In the future, I would like to take advantage of the experience of lab life, to contribute to society. If possible I am willing to make contribution to further development of Japan and the world.
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">Finally, I have an advice for those who wish to enter Tokimatsu Laboratory. In my opinion, our laboratory is not suitable for those who are always waiting for instruction, but could be a wise option for people who wish to carry out research themselves to reach their academic goals. Anyone who is concerned about or want to know more about the environment in our lab, please come to visit Tokimatsu Laboratory.&nbsp;</span><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Testimonials from Professor:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>I have received an email from him before I officially take up the job and obtain my own email account of the university. This which makes his contact the first contact I receive. When he participated in the lab orientation and I checked the personal profile he wrote, I was surprised. This was because I realized he undertook his studies under the supervision of my great masters, Mori Shunsuke sensei, who shaped one of fields I am specialized in. I was wondering why he applied for our lab. Later, I realized the obtained more than 800 points in TOEIC test and got the highest scores of the written Value System test. 
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"></span><br></div><div>He, who managed to get accepted into your school, impressed me when I communicated with him by showing how committed he is, and showing a willing and holding to his own goals. His corporation and the leadership he showed, beside his colleague Ore, among their juniors was extraordinary. I later realized he has developed these qualities and skills by taking care of his family, and thanks to the baseball game that he has been playing for a long time, which he developed the communication and decision-making skills. I feel that I am the one who learned from him. 
</div><div><br></div><div>I can not count how many times he helped managing our lab. Along with his colleagues Takahashi and Izumi, they did not alone help with the Bayu’s Farewell party - that took a place in the summer of 2014-  and welcoming our guests at the lab entrance, but they also took Ore’s part and helped more than 5 Chinese students with their entry sheet and job interview training. Beside managing the three joint-labs, he helped developing the lab website (took over a year) and taught statistics analysis and writing to his juniors. Even what is thought to be a norm in Japanese labs, with the wave of globalization, and the Free-ride concept of international students, an issue of more pressure placed on Japanese students will occur.
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"></span><br></div><div>&nbsp;Regarding the lab, he moved forward implementing his own ideas. He managed to develop his graduation thesis and set goals to participate in domestic and international conferences. By aiming to do so, he made an effort and wrote a paper contains 1000 letter and applied for peer review international meeting that has high ranking and succeed to present his poster. He academic path was resources business (apparently, same as his family members), hence, he spent his first year of short-term overseas dispatch in Singapore, then finishing with the international meeting, he undertook his studies in Rochester Institute of Technology in greenly New York city. He also wrote two papers for his graduation thesis. Being his supervisor, I could not provide him enough guidance as he was hopping, however, I am happy to have the chance of supporting him over the past two years and I expect him to achieve his dream of being in the top position in some company.

            <div class="col-xs-12 lead">Please let me introduce myself. I am Arif from Indonesia. I came to Japan on April 2015 as new master student in Tokimatsu Laboratory. One of the unforgettable memory, I was picked up by my tutor when I first time coming to this country. It is Japanese way, to help new student and make them comfortable in adaptation.  
<div><br></div><div>It has been a privilege for me to be associated with Tokyo Institute of Technology and Tokimatsu Laboratory. Many wonderful things come to mind – the enriching classes; the challenging discussions; the opportunities in professional development; and the personal attention given to me by Professor Tokimatsu. That kind of encouragement has been very valuable and good feeling for me. 
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Completing my master study brought me the creative challenge of thinking, writing, the great satisfaction of good work and 2 years of experience honed into a fine work – the master study itself. During this time, I feel more self-respect and self-esteem and a sense of joy and relief. Thank you for the opportunity to do this and treating me with respect in the process. Attending class at this university was also a very worthwhile experience for me. Tokyo Institute of Technology is one of the most prestigious universities in Japan, especially in the Engineering field. It was an honor to study at the university, attend lectures taught by professors that are making world-renowned discoveries, and be introduced to some of the advanced laboratories. Moreover, by being in the international academic program, I was exposed to a variety of learning perspectives and differences in interests. I have come to realize that to really make a valuable contribution to the society, it is important that one addresses the needs and concerns of the society.
</div><div><br></div><div>Come on back to our Laboratory. In our lab, we have a seminar (we call it as “zemi”) held every week. In our lab, there are 3 professors and has more than 30 students with different nationalities. We have to make a presentation and share our research to all lab member. Through this opportunity, I was introduced to the process of scientific research and, in working closely with my professor-advisor. I like the friendly atmosphere here during this process and the fact the teachers are really close to the students. Prof Tokimatsu is very helpful Sensei. He was able to provide some of fruitful discussion. He was also able to provide great feedback and encouragement. We are very supported in our studies. Another Professors are really kind and their way of teaching is really interesting. They are also very motivational. I also enjoyed the spirited discussions among students. They are very brilliant student.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;To any new student coming to the University and our Lab, I would say: “Throw yourself at every opportunity that comes your way. Do things you enjoy, but find the right balance between studying and socializing..”

            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p><strong>Reza Nadimi:</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">Doubtlessly, my PhD period at Tokyo Institute of Technology (Titech) was among the best years of my educational life. I was challenged to pursue my dreams in energy studies, through attending in various energy related-classes at Titech and Tokimatsu lab with diverse technical backgrounds, ideas, and thoughts. Techno-economic, socio-economic, and environmental risk analysis are three pillars of the Lab, to reach an integrated assessment energy system.</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>Lab members define their own research plans in line with these pillars and conduct their projects. Communications between lab members are increased by extension the overlapping of defined projects. My personal experience about communication backed into a project in which I myself with energy economic study get involved with social study. The result of this cooperation improved my knowledge in socio-economic aspect of the lab project, which was very brilliant experience. Apart of scientific discussion, lab members enjoy of attending in several parties during each semester as I did and get relaxed. Usually, Karaoke is one of the exciting entertainments during such parties, never lost it.  
</p><p><br></p><p>I really appreciate my academic supervisor, Professor Koji Tokimatsu, provided various opportunities for me to present my research activities, not only in weekly seminars, but also in other venues such as universities, and international conferences. The results of these opportunities were promotion of effective communication and collaboration with a network of peers. Participation and presentation at Energy Studies Institute (ESI) of National University of Singapore, Energy Research Institute of Nanyang Technology University of Singapore, and Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan are some of the examples, come to mind. It was a good practice for me to improve my presentation skills as well as my self-confidence. One more thing, Professor Tokimatsu was not just my academic supervisor, he was always advised me in job hunting process, which is beyond of the tasks of an academic supervisor.     
</p><p>&nbsp;I had also chance to be a teaching assistance two times, which enabled me to consider my English language skills and examine my previous teaching experiences with students from different nationalities at Titech. Last but not least, you will find yourself as much as freedom in conducting your desired research at Professor Tokimatsu lab.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p><strong>Professor's comments:</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p>His first contact was on my birthday, November 2015. I know “Teheran” of his graduated university, that must be the top one in overall Iran, and his score was extremely high. Why he contacted with me? ... I understood his situations gradually after his enrollment, which cannot be disclosed here I had known as an academic supervisor. I suppose those who experienced in society have any similar experience. After something troubles in administrative procedure, he finally enrolled as a MEXT scholarship student in Sep 2016.
</p><p><br></p><p>His performance had been extremely high even though he was in 30’s, from enrollment to graduation. His extremely high motivation and ambitions, speedy work, plan-do-see-action (PDCA) cycle, and his communication by “report-contacting-consulting (hourensou in Japanese, not spinach)”. In the beginning stage, he requested to discuss planning further months away and he surprised that when I said with panic “I cannot afford to serve you in any minute to discuss right now and talk you this matter later since lots of tasks are mounted over coming days now”.
</p><p>He was extremely excellent. It is too overstating but “nothing can be taught to you” in middle of the century Italy, however, challenges in the age are come across in any time and any place. He had suffered such severe difficulties even though he had all the way come to Japan. Similar to experiences through other students, I had flush backed my own experiences. I had recognized at that moment that I were besides of him. That was incredibly important role of academic supervisor for students.
</p><p><br></p><p>Actually that was at that timing I had made one of the largest roles as a supervisor. He had been in severe situation. We had step forward by “three legs by two”. Hard time for us. We altogether had overcome by his extreme efforts and never give-up mind sets as well as my own resourceful manner. Once he had overcome, he had been made successful breakthroughs afterwards. Sometime, the Lady Luck smiles to him. He had successfully one of students award (only him outside from the Western offshoots) in the IAEE 40th Singapore conference.
</p><p>His final challenge was actually let his thesis had accepted. He aimed “earlier graduation by two year in Ph.D” in our new educational system. He must be the first person to complete this after the renewed system. It was, indeed, or unexpectedly, extraordinary difficult and challenges for us, since no processor exists and he was the exact front runner. But his genuine efforts and achievements let the “ultra-heavy” door open. It must be rewarding to his wife.
</p><p><br></p><p>The Lady Luck smiles those who paid efforts to the “last and final” drop like him. This implies me as opposite; mine is insufficient. My selling efforts such a genuine student across the world was indeed unsuccessful, meaning my power was insufficient. Now he is working in an innovative company engaging in his continuing Ph.D work. He must be blessed by the smiling Lady Luck. He is genuine honor, straight forward, modest, and the mirror of scholar. Such a genuine scholar exists.

            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>Greetings, I am Gan Chiao Sing, an undergraduate student from University of Malaya, Malaysia. It was great to be selected to join this 3-month exchange program. I have gained a lot of experiences, not only from conducting a research, but also including those interesting cultural and living experiences. Before meeting with my supervisor Tokimatsu sensei, the coordinator of this exchange program told me that I was so lucky to join Tokimatsu laboratory. It was so true as Tokimatsu sensei is such a kind and nice person that you won’t feel stress or uneasy when talking to him. It was my pleasure to be able to work with him. And I was fortunate enough to be assigned with 3 helpful tutors throughout the program. Hereby, I would like to thank Dyla san for her patience and guidance for my research project. I also highly appreciate the help from Michino san and Yutaro san in handling the complicated documents and procedures for my 3-month stay in Japan. 
</p><p><br></p><p>Regarding the research project, it is really interesting to conduct a research topic which is related to my home country in Japan. As it was new to me, I have taken some time to get familiar with the topic and understand the palm oil sector and development of biomass in Malaysia. Dyla san’s guidance and explanation make me understand the topic better and hence, I can successfully complete my research in Tokyo Tech as well as carry out the presentation during the MISW workshop 2018. 
</p><p><br></p><p>Besides the research, I have attended classes for Japanese language which were taken place in the Ookayama campus. I have learnt some basic greetings and common phrases which are very useful during my stay in Japan. But since the exchange period is quite short, I only manage to learn how to speak some Japanese phrases. If there is sufficient time, I would like to learn more on how to read and write Japanese words as well, so that I can at least understand a little about the label on the goods and products and no need to rely on the Google translate while I am in the supermarket and convenience store in Japan.
</p><p><br></p><p>I have also joined the site visits to several companies in Japan. It was great to witness the high-end technologies and high-efficient system in Japan which makes them to become one of the leading countries in science and technology. Moreover, the special activities organised by Tokyo Tech (elementary school visit, traditional tea ceremony and flower arrangement) gave me a chance to broaden my understanding towards the Japanese cultures and beliefs. I know that I most probably won’t be able to join this kind of events if I am only come here as a tourist. So, I highly appreciate the efforts and preparation from Tokyo Tech which give me a very memorable experience in Japan.
</p><p><br></p><p>To conclude, the 3-month stay in Japan is full of joys and happiness. I enjoy the work and interaction with Tokimatsu sensei and also with my tutors. I am amazed with the laboratory’s atmosphere where all members from the laboratory are kind and close to each other. I have definitely gained a remarkable exchange experience in Tokimatsu laboratory.

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>First, I want to introduce myself. My name is Anggoro Cahyo from Indonesia. I came to Tokimatsu Lab as master student for enrollment at fall semester (October) 2016.
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">I had chosen this laboratory from the desire to apply geography, especially remote sensing and geospatial information systems into environmental management and renewable energy field.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Joined to Tokimatsu Lab was not an easy thing but it was not too difficult. The first thing that we have to do is to communicate with Tokimatsu Sensei via email by including our curriculum vitae and research proposal. After going through a discussion with an email about our research, the next step was administration in the form of enrollment and completing the required documents. The interview phase as part of the exam to qualify as a master student was also held via skype, in addition several questions from faculty members of the Department also conducted via email.
</p><p>This is amazing experience that I ever had for this two years to joint this Lab. I was surprised and exited when I came for the first time in this Lab because I came from Geography science in my bachelor that it was difference science background from others Lab member. But that is my way to learn a lot and expand the application of my knowledge, especially in the energy field.
</p><p>Tokimatsu Sensei plays a big role in guiding, giving advice and providing support in conducting research. The opportunity that given in performed different research and attended several international conferences greatly motivated me to finalize this research. Otherwise, this was also given me more insight and improved my ability to make presentations.
</p><p><br></p><p>A pleasant lab atmosphere is also another supporting factor. Lab members who always support and discuss each other make us comfortable in the lab and feel helped by suggestions for our research.
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">One other experience that impressed me besides attending the conference was when I visited a power plant on Belitung Island. During this visit, I gained a lot of experiences and knowledges, especially about how to generate electricity both from renewable energy and from coal as the main energy source. Knowledges and understanding how to utilize of waste as energy source for electricity generation is also a new science for me and it is very useful especially in relation to my work in the field of disaster and climate change mapping and in relation to regional planning. Utilization of waste as a source of energy provides a new outlook especially on oil palm plantations which during my thesis research that the main problem in the management of plantations and palm oil mill is their waste. Wood, shell and fiber waste can be utilized again as fuel and liquid waste from palm oil mills with an anaerobic process can be used as a source for biogas power plant.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p>For all of you who are still doing research on Tokimatsu Lab, I just want to say keep your spirit. Always attend in the Lab and communicating with Sensei and friends is either way to improve the quality of our research.
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">For those who want to join Tokimatsu Lab, hopefully this testimonial is useful. I only can give an idea about how much comfortable and fun to joint in  Tokimatsu Lab. Difficulties and obstacles must be exist when we do research and study but by having good Sensei and the support from others lab members, this will be easy to be passed.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Once again I want to say thank you to Prof. Tokimatsu for the opportunity that given to me to join and study in this lab also for some experiences that directly given through discussions and indirectly through conferences and field trips.
</p><p>Hopefully Tokimatsu Lab will be develop with increasing in the number of members and publications so that more people are known.
</p><p>
</p><p>Best regards,   
</p><p>Anggoro Cahyo</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Professor's comments:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>He gave me his first contact in Feb 2016 via email, stating that he is an Indonesian governmental officer born in Gajamada, and proposing that resource assessment using GIS. This proposal was my first experience using GIS and remote sensing technique, however, I accepted his proposal so that mutual benefits to lab members, especially those engaging in similar topics. He enrolled in Sep 2016.
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;In good or bad sense, students are generally troublesome, but his case gives me little bothersome or worry; he conducts his work steady. He requests me to have meetings in quite appropriate timing, and reporting me in very compact of his work. Moreover, he was always preparing supplemental documents so that he can reply any of my inquiry. This well-preparation must not only come from what he leant from his works in serving the Government but from his nature.
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;From that period, number of lab members are doubling by every semester. Before and after till now on, I always spare my time to discuss with my students. But the because of the growing number, I decided to make a new role to arrange meeting slots for all students. This required dedicated and careful consideration to me and students who are just only consider themselves. He was the right person to devote to this role. This is just a half year after his joining. Actually, after his leave, this role cannot be maintained. Not only this but another he devoted to running our laboratory operation with careful consideration to our members including me.
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;He sometime escaping somewhere for XXX to maintain his stable situation in daily life; however that must be essential for his coming here, leaving his all families in his country. We had been in the end making jokes each other; in his case, laughing me forgotten I had talked and scheduled.
</p><p>Such his attitude, he is a really reliable person in his proper communication and steady works, I could leave everything for him with minimum efforts to work on. His contributions were large enough, in time saving and well preparation. Every task had steady conducted for field survey, international conferences, writing up papers, and technical investigation tours. His performance is so well developed and perfect that he must contribute his county with well promoted.

</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">Hello everyone!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">I am very honored to leave my words on the homepage of Prof. Koji Tokimatsu’s lab. The 10 weeks spent at Tokyo Institute of Technology is the most memorable part of my life. Choosing to participate in this summer exchange program is a choice that will never be regretted.</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;"><br></span></p><p>Before I came to Japan, Prof. Koji Tokimatsu very kindly assigned a student from China, Xue Jie, to contact me to help me solve some problems. During the opening lunch on the 3rd, I met Xue Jie. She was very friendly and kind. After I encountered some difficulties in my life, I would seek her help. She helped me very enthusiastically.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>Since I am cross-professional, I did’t know anything of chosen research topic when making a plan. In view of this, Prof. Koji Tokimatsu specially invited Reza-san, the first author of the paper I read, to tutor me during the holiday. Reza-san's lectures were clear and easy to understand, which has benefited me a lot. In fact, he has graduated, and he did not have to come to give me a lecture during his break. This is something unimaginable in China and I am very touched.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>Prof. Koji Tokimatsu is very approachable and cheerful, and is completely different from the imaginary Japanese professor. Later, when I wanted to change my research topic, he also accepted it with pleasure. He only worried that he might not be able to give me professional guidance on new topic. In fact, when I showed him the slides, he made very professional comments and suggestions. The laboratory held the China-Japan-Korea Joint Symposium in Karuizawa. Although I did not publish the results, the professor warmly invited me to participate free of charge. Considering that I did not have a Japanese bank account to get the return fee, the professor handed in instead with great care.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>The students in the lab come from countries all over the world, but they are all warm and friendly, taking the initiative to talk to me and introduce themselves. Originally, I was an introvert. I didn't often communicate with people when I was in China. After that, I became much more cheerful and infected by everyone's enthusiasm.
</p><p>Many thanks to everyone I met in Japan!</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to China!

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>I joined Tokimatsu laboratory in fall 2017, as a 4th batch scholar of a JICA program, namely ABE (African business education initiative). This program is mainly dedicated to African with working experience to study and do internships in Japan, in order to achieve some strategic goals for the Japanese government and bridge the gap with African markets.
</p><p>At that time, I was the first Egyptian student to join the laboratory. and by defining laboratory, it is a research group that share one study place under the academic supervisor. there are also regular meetings (seminars) for all the lab members during which they can present their research progress, practice for conferences etc., these seminars are very helpful to practice presenting and engaging with audience as well as receiving feedback and research directions.
</p><p><br></p><p>During my stay in the lab, there was other 2 academic supervisors with their lab members sharing the same study space, Prof. Yoshikawa lab and Prof. Takahashi lab. It was an opportunity to know different research disciplines like bio-mass and waste management and treatment. There were pros and cons for that, for example, we shared the same weekly research seminars, it often happens that the presented research is far away from my own research focus. On the other hand, it was a good opportunity to know more about different research trends and a plus was that the lab is very English friendly as English is the main language used. For me, one of the biggest gains was making lots of long lasting friendships with all other lab members, as there is almost no barriers between the 3 laboratories and we can jointly do several activities together; lab parties was an example, which by the way was very Muslim friendly and always keen on offering halal food and drink options. 
</p><p><br></p><p>As for research, Prof. Tokimatsu is keen on having diverse students, research topics and nationalities in his lab. Prof. Tokimatsu has a full command of English language making it comfortable communicating with him, he is a good listener, as he tries to offer advice and guidance to his students after carefully understanding their needs. In my case, I was interested in Electric vehicles and Prof. Tokimatsu managed to introduce me to Prof. Muhammad Aziz, who was specializing in the field of V-2-G, and by working with him, I had my first experience joining and presenting at an academic conference, namely Applied Energy Symposium and Forum, REM2018, in Greece. 
</p><p><br></p><p>In my opinion, the main qualities needed to join this lab are self-motivation, persistence and dedication as students in Japan are expected to plan their own research goals and define the research objective and what is needed to achieve that. Accordingly, good time management is needed, and the ability to work in a multi-disciplinary environment and people from different study backgrounds.

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p><strong>Kengo Takeda:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>When I was a college senior, I got known this Tokimatsu Laboratory.
</p><p>At that time, although I was belonging the other major, I was more interested in combining academic areas and engineering than deepening one specific engineering area, such as economics, politics and environment. From these interest, I worked hard to learn from non-essential lectures both in TokyoTech or not.
</p><p>However I was also often so troubled the relative lack of passion and interest for pure engineering which usual contemporaries have.
</p><p>Since I knew the laboratory, the policy was the contributing between technologies and society, so I thought that this laboratory is the best environment to complete research as master student for me who is would like to research combined field between technology and other social studies
</p><p><br></p><p>As the style of study in this laboratory, each student can study own theme freely based on their awareness of problems with warmful support by Tokimatsu sensei.
</p><p>Tokimatsu sensei always helped us to make our days in university and future lives on both private and public side. In my case there were some so impressive events. First, he prepares individual meeting time almost weekly to arrange my interest scattered roundly at first. Second, the laboratory of members allows my attending the collaboration researching joint researching workshop with Yamashita laboratory in Hitotsubashi University even though I had not attended to Tokimatsu laboratory. And he had kind support for my job hunting not just mere advice.
</p><p>This 2 years in Tokimatsu laboratory is short for me but quite deep and various high density on my life, such as daily life with so many foreign student and researchers, which means Japanese is minority, twice researching activity at Uppsala university in Sweden, twice presentation in academic conference and submitting refereeing researching paper.
</p><p><br></p><p>In addition, I thought that in this laboratory we could grow some abilities which is also required not only as a student but also a member of society, such as keeping own passion for own task, response capabilities for various environment and administrative skills.
</p><p>I really wish that students who are interested in collaboration between technologies and other area get great achievement and discover successful future, and I trust in everything of this laboratory helps your life.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Professor's comments:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The first email I had received was more than 3 year before in May or June. The message was formal and “old” style, stating that he majored electrical engineering though he beloved humanity and social science so much that he got those credits from outside of Tokyo Tech and that he had in mind to work on energy security issue. Once I talked with him in my office, I inspired his huge perspectives, which was overwrapped my own experience in reading many humanity literatures during electronic circuit experiments in bachelor course, and recognized that he must not go well in lab other than mine in our Institute, immediately accept him to be a lab member once he passed an enrolment examination. That was my first experience to meet him up. I recommended him to apply Hitotsubashi university as passing the examination was not guaranteed and invited him to join a regular joint seminar with prof Yamashita there together. I was surprised that he knows the campus as if it is his own garden. He explained that he got more than 60% credits in humanity and social science, from Hitotsubashi and Keio univ. “I had just chose Tokodai as I had just became in good at mathematics and science”, which was also overwrapped with my past.
</p><p>He overpassed his bachelor’s remaining “winter” season, spring has come. I met him together with prof. Ikegami, working together with the Uppsala-Tokyo Tech project, who appraised him greatly to be an academic co-advisor. The meeting was in lunch time to talk with his research topic and direction. He wore three-piece formal suits with his appearance in “old guy”, brought his hand-made big sandwiches. Their appearance are very beautiful and extremely delicious using halal meat with Indian spice. I believed the sophisticated ones must be sold out immediately even priced at 500 JPY inside of our campus. Truly astonished. He followed Japanese old style to bring Japanese sake bottles for gifts, till his graduation in faithful, even though I declined to do so.
</p><p>Once we started his work, we soon recognized all must be explored (i.e., specific topic, target, and methodology) since the theme contains too broad topics. I handed all the materials I had corrected over my past working experiences, and suggested to pick up a few or some to be reported. In the end, what we had in mind from the theme were differed between us. Target is geographically diversed – Mid East, South-East Asia, China, North America, and Russia. He choose two sets of patterns combined with the geography and technologies, to which importance of justification is suggested. We discussed many times regarding to methods, referring various literatures regardless of targets nor theme. He asked me “what and by how?” I replied “Do not wait for my direction, but just try and error. Do not think it difficult but anything small is OK for you that can easily start by yourself. Think widely, act locally.” I lately recognized that my reply was the same given from my academic supervisor in my graduate course student, and my thoughtless through supervising students after quarter century. In the beginning he was embarrassing, while after his struggling based on his wide knowledge, he reported he might manage by text mining on newspapers. Based on my own past experience, I had expected him once he made one step forward, then started to work more steps, to which he successfully followed.
</p><p>I gave him twice opportunities in M1 and M2 to outbound for Uppsala University in Sweden with connection by prof. Ikegami. The first one is a trial to live (or survive) there and get started to his work together with prof. Mikael Hook. He managed to save his expenses by cooking himself based on his cooking ability and foodstuffs. He must be a Japanese guy having survival ability comparative with foreign guy students who also cook by themselves. He can survive by himself alone after his retirement 40 year later, promising. In his M2 autumn opportunity to go to Uppsala, his progress was roughly middle of whole his thesis. In his outbound preparation, he reported to me probably he seemed to conduct his work together with Mikael after email exchanges to him. I bed to believe in him and to decide his outbound. This decision let me grow to believe student potential. He improved his own developed methodology, convincing himself. In November he could write his paper easily based on his writing ability, sent it out to peer-review slot of a conference by the society of energy and resources (successfully published from the journal in July 2019). He could well develop momentum, easily complied his graduation thesis. He could conduct his research in both labs Suzukakedai and Oookayama, supposing he may have ability to learn with balance.
</p><p>Regarding to the job hunting (details cannot be disclosed), we perfectly work together by “three legs by two”. His desire in his employment is in short, where he can perform his comprehensive ability, rather than being expected to technical skills (stereo type in our Institute), in the business areas to secure energy and resources covering all through value chain covering development, transport, retail sales, distribution, and use. I consulted to him importance for him to prioritize company’s culture and his personal feelings are well matched. Finally, he smoothly got naitei (a final confirmation to be allowed to work in a company) along this strategy. Through this experience, I recognized the importance of consultancy to provide alternative solutions in different angle by who understands him/her well, not sticking to his/her own thought. This recognition is totally same with that through collaboration for inter-discipline research work.
</p><p>His ability is too deep to see its bottom. The highest reliability is given to his accounting ability and attitude cultivated by help to his parent’s house business. In daily communication, I could relax and leave tasks once he mentioned “Let me done this and I will complete well. Leave this to me and relax”. Even such him, sometime he made careless misses (sometimes serious ones), that produced a “pillow word” like “it is unlike to your behavior”. He is too stupidly honest – I sometimes recommended him to learn from Moe-chan in the same grade who is clever and calculating. He can drink a lot comparative with me, and once he starts to drink, his wisdom talks are explosion, attracting surroundings. As a final word, I sincerely wish he continued to be lead by prospective bosses who understand his talent, bloomed in my lab like a fish to water.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p></div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p><strong>Chen Meng:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>During the last two or three months before my graduation of master, Dr.Tokimatsu will take at least one or two times a week to meet with me, one is to discuss the specific method of model calculation, and the other is to modify the Japanese details of the paper word by word. One night, meeting lasting until at 9 o'clock. On the way home, We take a train together. That twenty-minute conversation may remain in my memory.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>At that time, the calculation was finally over, and the summary were started. We sat in the tram and talked about the revision plan of the final paper content. We talking like friend, sigh with the feeling that the work of the past two years was finally completed, and I feel accomplishment about it. But the time from application to the final master's thesis, was past so quickly.
</p><p>When I applied for Tokimatsu lab 2 years ago, I was fortunate to meet Dr.Tokimatsu at Beijing where he had conference at.In fact, by the time I was not clear with my research details, so Dr.Tokimatsu has been hesitating for a long time to accept me. However, when I met him at Beijing,I bring my re-conceived research plan and firmly stated my research willingness in the field of energy and environment. I finally got the approval from Dr.Tokimatsu
</p><p>
</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunately, after I entered school, I wanted to start an economic analysis on hydrogen energy. Dr.Tokimatsu not only agreed with my plan, but also introduced me to the professors of the two best research institutes in the field of hydrogen energy in our school, Ihara lab and Oda lab, and carried out economic analysis in both macro and micro aspects. Although this means double the amount of work, to be honesty, it feels very tired and stressed. (At the time, I had my own desk in three labs, and I had to move back and forth between three labs every week, Facing the super-meeting of the six professors by myself) but now it seems that my knowledge improvement and accomplishment are not only doubled.
</p><p>With the help of professors from three laboratory, I achieved academic achievements that I could not imagine. I participated in international and domestic conference, published journal articles, and had the opportunity to act as translator for the chairman of the China Hydrogen Energy Association in symposium.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>In addition, my lab life was also very happy. Although I only go to the lab once or twice a week, I am looking forward to chatting with members from all over the world every time I went to lab room. At other times, I communicated with the lab members (English) and the teacher (Japanese) through emails. This not only improving my language skills, but also help me to learned the way they thinking and communicating at japan society. This is the most important asset I have learned at the time.
</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, the wealth I got from studies, research，normal Life at tokimatsu lab will not end with my graduation. After graduation, I will enter Toyota China's new energy technology planning department, and will continue to develop in the future, especially in the field of energy. I will apply the professional knowledge I have learned in the past two years, the way of thinking, the way of social communication in Japan, and I hope to make my own contribution to the development of Chinese-Japanese energy technology exchanges.</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Professor's comments:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Her first email contact was summer in three year ago. In the email exchanges, she finished her exchange program in Tohoku university, worked in hydrogen experimental works, then started to seek labs in energy systems analysis for her graduate course study. I asked her why you don’t join to a famous lab in Tohoku, she replied no enrollment system for foreign students. She mentioned that she grew up in Beijing while born in Japan, and that she would like to move to Tokyo in consideration of job hunting while Sendai is very good place to live in, then requested me to visit my office. During email exchanges I found she gave me responses in appropriate Japanese with relatively prompt. Then I expected smooth communications in research guidance if I agreed to accept as a lab member.
</p><p><br></p><p>The next opportunity to meet up with her was an international conference in Beijing, October. She listened presentations for related works whether she can have any interests and met with the scholars. We talked together if she joined what you expected to me, what I could serve for her, and what she wanted to engaging in after her graduation. Her reply was that she was interested in waste related issues because of its business area of her father in Beijing, and that wanted to work in Japan contributing to China’s environmental improvement by joining in Japanese private company, letting their asthma-sick parents move to Japan due to bad environmental condition in Beijing. I made up my mind to accept as a lab member.
</p><p><br></p><p>In reality, such expectations were fall short in both research theme and job hunting. Instead, I had learnt from her behavior, which must be “normal” for Chinese but “disturbing and annoying” for Japanese. It is very natural that students must seek their future chances and possibilities within short year (a few) to make his/her best decisions. Even though I totally understand this “general” tendency, her “specific” characteristic had been indeed “her own” immediate mind change, totally different from other students. In addition to the sudden change, lots of selfish behaviors had been observed that cannot be ignorable. Traditional, old style faculties shout to make expulsion. “At least in Japan, your such attitude or behavior are never allowed, you must learn from Kengo, the same grade, who always acts as a Japanese traditional model” I had persuaded her many times.
</p><p><br></p><p>After joining an international conference in Hong Kong in her M2 summer, she went to play in China main land, in addition, she caused severe accident during a mountain climbing in the begin of October. Because of these reasons, no progress had made in the beginning of November. “I don’t believe you can make progress on your thesis enough for graduation even though you spend all 24 hours a day on your research, including end-of-year and new-year break.” I said while she replied “I am confident I could manage completing my thesis even in a short period since I had made a haunted house in a day!.” I did not debated this “strange” reply, even though stunned. Her pride drove her engine started seriously. From then I had obliged to have meetings twice in a week (one in Suzukakedai, the other is Oookayama); one for research progress and the other is thesis compilation. Every time it takes more than several hours, exceeding over 9pm (business as usual in conducting research). That was very tough time for me, but I had worked for her.
</p><p><br></p><p>Regarding to her new-year break, we had carefully checked and made up our schedule so that she can work anywhere outside of our office. I believe that such a balancing between businesses in house and society must be required after her graduation and that she can grow up through this experience. But simultaneously I had sentenced to her that all her decision was up to her but self-responsibility, and that I could not help her with further more if her graduation was delayed. This decision making was the toughest for me after suffered many her mind changes and selfish behaviors. Could she really graduate? I had only way to believe her. That must be the moment I had grown as a supervisor through students. It was the very end of January, just a week before final examination, when we felt completed and nothing further can be made to be exhaust.
</p><p><br></p><p>The time together with her in “three legs in two person” was truly tough. Moe was “genuine naughty”, but ironically I had felt sincerely attached because of her mentioned above. This might as well one of the awards to academic supervisors. She as well accompanied with me in Japanese sake. For her honor, still after her graduation she pursued to complete her peer-reviewed article (accepted for publication in e-book, Springer) so that she would like to follow her senior’s suits.

The interview was done on the same day,andYoshikawa sensei suggested to conduct researchin Techno-economic assessment. He suggested Tokimatsu sensei was assigned as a potential supervisor.I spent 3.5 years as a student in the Tokimatsu laboratory. The experiences I gained fromthe Tokyo Institute of Technology were differentfrommy master'sand degree. It is crucial to conduct research in the area of expertiseto avoid dependency on the supervisor. Besides, it is essentialto have asmallgroup circle with the same research area. Being a Ph.D.student in the Tokimatsu laboratory is about the challengeof responsibility, independence, culture, knowledge,and resource.I am glad as I am the first female Ph.D.student who graduated from Tokimatsu Laboratory.Lastly, I would like to thanks Tokimatsu sensei for his willingness to become my Ph.D.supervisor and towards his contributions towards my research.</p></div>

I belong to Energy Course that it very rare for foreign student to enroll this course. I am very proud to be member of TokimatsuLab for past two years. I remember that my document for enroll requirement submitted one day before deadline after Sensei give me confirmation for those. This laboratory is very good, even for foreigner or Japanese student. Almost of student coming from all around the world because Tokimatsu sensei has idealism to invite them. We have international atmosphereto share all the knowledge from each student but Tokimatsu Sensei keep Japanese style to supervise all his student. Japanese student in this lab alsocan share their knowledge and experienceeach other not only about academic but also their daily activity and very helpful if anyone need help for administration problem.Tokimatsu Sensei give us freedom to decide our research topic even he didn’t reallyexpert about our topic. But he tried to contribute and help our progress to build the good research. He knows all of our weakness and try to improve step by step. He always gives us priority and spirit to take care our family. He can manage all of studenteven He is very busy person as in charge for internationalization of university. Because of that, you have many opportunitiesto internship to abroad from his networking and share your research to certain conference with laboratory budget. The conference very helpful to improve our presentation skill that he always concerns about this. We must deliver our research topic to all people as simple as we can that they can understand what We did. Tokimatsu sensei give me many advicesto make our research can easily deliver to people with efficient presentation. For anyone to join, this laboratory is very recommended who want to improve their capability by yourself. You can enjoy your study and have opportunity to learn many things about japan. So, don’t hesitate contact Tokimatsu Sensei or our lab memberto join this laboratory. Good luck!</p></div>

I hadacomplete freedom to work the topics of my interest and as a result, the three-year journey gave me immense study satisfaction. Instead of rushing the students to come withquick research results, Prof. Tokimatsualways focused on providing the ideal platform by allowing students sufficient time to develop all the necessary fundamentals of their research areas. Therefore, by the time I started my research, I had already become very familiar with the crucial details in my fieldof study. Besides that, unlike many supervisors, Prof. Tokimatsu does not require his students tomeet setlab core hours. Instead, he gives them the freedom to show up in the Laboratory at the time they want. He, at the same, trusts his students to conduct their work and report to him periodically. Such a great way that allows students to develop self-disciplineskills and realize the status of being a graduate student. Tokimatsu Laboratory provides a vibrant study experience through the international atmosphere the Laboratory enjoys. Interacting with other students, who come from various backgrounds and different walks of life, has expanded my awareness and the way I look at life. As for the cons, Although Tokyo Tech is equipped with the most advanced experimental instruments and technologies, it is a nationaluniversity with a very long history. Thus, it is better not to expect brand new desks and chairs. Further, Tokimatsu Laboratory is located in a rather distant area from Tokyo. This can be, to some extent, inconvenient for those who live in Tokyo and hate long train commute. Although Prof. Tokimatsu also offers his time -when possible-in Ookayama campus, which is located in Tokyo. I will cherish the memories that we had in our group immensely.I hope for more successes coming to Prof. Tokimatsuand his group.</p></div>

            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>The first time I got known about Tokimatsu Lab was through the introduction of Prof. Kurishima, Shibaura Institute of Technology, my first academic advisor. At that time, I was interested in learning and studying about the solution for energy and environmental problem in Southeast Asia. I was so much attracted to Tokimatsu laboratory environment in which international students from around the world including Southeast Asia worked hard to contribute to solving energy and environmental problems so that I determined to join this laboratory.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In Tokimatsu Laboratory, research themes are not given by professors or seniors, but it is required to set the themes and carry out research activities by myself. Prof. Tokimatsu will check the student's progress on proper time, and guide students by pointing out and giving advice when the research direction is not in place. Technical issues that you face in your research activities must be solved by conducting literature review and simulations by yourself. For this reason, it will be difficult to complete your thesis in this laboratory if you cannot have self-control and responsible for your own research activities.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;However, Tokimatsu laboratory is very generous in supporting students who are actively seeking opportunities. Basically, you cannot conduct research on themes related to overseas unless you have connections and financial support with overseas university faculties. Even it is difficult to make a connection and financial support, Prof. Tokimatsu will support you as much as possible. I myself had no connections with overseas faculties or abundant budget, but with the support of the professor, I had the opportunity to stay overseas for a total of 7 months for research.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;As you can see, there is no doubt that Tokimatsu Lab is a tough laboratory unless it is a student with aspiration and ambition to achieve your objectives. However, it is a great environment for students who want to develop their own path. If you are interested in Tokimatsu Lab, please come to visit us. We are always welcome your visiting.&nbsp;</p></div>
